Containers Available

- **Array**: Fixed-size sequence of elements. Not available in C++98, but can be simulated using C-style arrays.
- **deque**: Double-ended queue that allows fast insertion and deletion at both ends.
- **Forward_list**: Singly linked list. Not available in C++98.
- **List**: Doubly linked list that allows fast insertion and deletion at both ends and at the middle.
- **Map**: Associative container that stores key-value pairs with unique keys, sorted by keys.
- **Queue**: FIFO (First In First Out) data structure that allows insertion at the back and removal from the front.
- **Set**: Associative container that stores unique elements, sorted by keys.
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that allows insertion and removal from the top.
- **Unordered_Map**: Associative container that stores key-value pairs with unique keys, not sorted. Not available in C++98.
- **Unordered_set**: Associative container that stores unique elements, not sorted. Not available in C++98.
- **vector**: Dynamic array that allows fast random access and fast insertion and deletion at the end.
